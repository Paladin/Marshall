1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 c5 8. 
Ne2 Nc6 9. Be3 cxd4 10. cxd4 Qa5+ {The opening is completely analogous to Loft-Martz, 
except that white has not moved f3 and black has not castled. This apparently small
difference is sufficient to afford a appreciable strengthening of white's play. With
11 Bd2! Qa3 12 Rb1 he can avoid the queen exchange and develop later threats of d5 and Bd2-b4.
Practice shows that black fails to achieve equality with this variation.} 
11. Qd2 O-O 12. Rc1 {This rook maneuver loses a tempo compared with the immediate Rd1 as played 
in Loft-Martz.} Rd8 13. Rc2 Bd7 14. O-O 
Qxd2 15. Rxd2 Na5! {The arrival of the black knight at c4 will be much stronger here than in the 
previous game, since white does not have the resource of Bf2 in reply.}
16. Bd3 Rac8 17. Rc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1 Rc8 19. Rc2 Rxc2 20. 
Bxc2 Nc4 21. Bg5 {White finds the best defense; he could not afford the breaking of his pawn structure
by ...Nxe3. The text seems to offer good chances to draw, but black has an important tactical
resource.} Bxd4 22. Bxe7 Ne3! {This interesting maneuver leads to a temporary tie-up of the white
pawns on the king's side. As a result black will be the first to mobilize his pawn majority.} 
23. Bd3 Ng4 24. Bh4 Ne5 25. Bc2 Be6 26. Bb3
b5 27. Bxe6 fxe6 {Black allows a slight weakness in his pawn structure, since white lacks the means to 
exploit it. In addition, black wishes to create an entry for his king among the white king-side pawns.
The latter will be decisive if white is forced to use his own king on the opposite wing.} 
28. Kf1 Kf7 29. Ke2 a5 30. f4! {White relies upon his own pawn majority to secure counter-chances.
He also increases the mobility of his stranded bishop.} Nc6 31. Be1 a4 32. Kd3 Bc5 33. 
e5 {Although the advance of the king-side pawns is the right defensive plan, the text is a serious
mistake. Black's reply gives him the necessary entry for his king, after which white will be unable
to defend both wings.} g5 34. g3 Kg6 35. Ke4 {He cannot allow Kf5 but now black threatens the other 
side.} Bb4 36. Bf2 gxf4 37. gxf4 Bd2 38. Ne2 Ba5 39. Nd4 {The exchange of knights leaves white with the
weaker bishop, but there was no valid defense against the advance of black's pawns. White was by now
very short on time.}
Nxd4 40. Bxd4 b4 41. h3 b3 42. axb3 axb3 43. Bb2 Bd2! {White is in zugzwang! with 44 Kd3 Bf4 45 Kc4 
Kf4 46 Kb3 Be5 47 Ba3 he could speculate upon being able to give up his bishop for the e-pawn and
still reach h1 with his king, thus making a theoretical draw. Black, however, should have no trouble 
avoiding this pitfall.} 44. h4 h5 {White lost on time.} 0-1
